# PROGRAMREPO
This Repo contains:
* Linear Regression from scratch
* Linear Regression with gradient descent v/s Linear Regression using Normal Equation (from scratch)
* Linear Regression with Socastic Gradiant Descent (from scratch)
* K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) with kfold cross validation (from scratch)
* Titanic dataset:  This was done as a part of the course work AM623D -Machine learning. We were a team of two. Tried to implement various ML algorithms on the titanic dataset and compared it's accuracy. Accuracy on valiatiion set, training set and have done k-fold cross validation.
  NOTE: A SCALAR IS USED, WHICH MIGHTH NOT BE APPLICABLE TO EVERY FUNCTION. THAT HS NOT BEEN TAEN INTO CONSIDERATION. NOT SURE ABOUT THE EFFECTS.
